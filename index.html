      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p> These days, with so many different ways to make coffee at home, you can feel overwhelmed even before you begin. We’re here to make it simpler for you. From our mainstay, the pour over, to the esoteric siphon pot, we’ll break down the different ways to make coffee, highlighting the qualities in each finished cup and the technical chops each method requires. By identifying the kind of coffee that you’re after and how much work you’re willing to do, you’ll be able to navigate your way to your preferred brew method. </p>

        <h2>The Differences Among Coffee Brewing Methods</h2>
        <p>All you need to make coffee is ground coffee, water, and a filter. But to understand the differences among coffee brewing methods, from start to finish, we’ll look at the following variables: the texture or mouthfeel of the finished drink (or “why we like it”); the filter material, brewing process, and tips for grind size (or “how it works”); and the ideal mind-set and prior experience of the home brewer (or “who’s it for”). </p>

    <h2>Pour Over Method</h2>
    <p> </p>
    <h3> Why We Like Pour Over Coffee</h3>
    <p>The pour over method produces coffee with a delicate and smooth texture that resides somewhere between juicy and tea-like. A pour over coffee’s flavor is often at its most expressive, partly due to the filtration, which adds polish and clarity to the cup, and partly due to the amount of water used in relation to the ground coffee. </p>
    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>A paper filter that fits into some sort of dripper is all you need for pour over coffee. The paper filter results in a clarified mouthfeel as it holds back oils and undissolved coffee particles from the final cup.</p>
    <p>While there are countless drippers on the market, we’re partial to our version, the Blue Bottle dripper. Engineered to take the guesswork out of brewing pour over coffee, its conical shape cuts a similar profile to other ceramic drippers, but its very design—a flat bed with 40 interior ridges—promotes more even extraction, bringing out the best flavors of the coffee.  </p>
    <p>If the pour over brew method appeals, but you’re eager to brew more than one cup at a time, the classic Chemex carafe can brew up to 8 cups of coffee at time.  </p>
    <h3>Tips on Grind</h3>
    <p>For single-cup drippers, a medium grind size about the coarseness of sea salt is optimal. The extraction time—the span of time from the first pour to the last—should take fewer than 3 minutes to achieve the most balanced flavors. For Chemex, the grind size will depend on the amount of coffee you use; if making more than a couple of servings, you’ll want the grind size to be slightly coarser than for a single-cup dripper, otherwise, the water will overextract the coffee, resulting in bitterness.</p>
    <h3>Who's It For?</h3>
    <p>Pour overs are for anyone who appreciates a short but focused morning ritual and isn’t afraid to experiment. While drippers are considered an “entry level” manual brew tool, using one does require focus and care. The biggest challenge for the pour over method is the pour technique, a series of four pours in which the stream of water leaving the kettle gently saturates the coffee grounds. Since it’s the method we use in our cafes most, we have our pour over method down to a science. Learn more about it in our brew guide. Throw in a scale, grinder, and swan neck kettle and you’ll be well on your way to coffee perfection.</p>

    <h2>French Press Method</h2>
    <p> </p>
    <h3> Why We Like French Press</h3>
    <p>We love the full-bodied coffee that comes from the French press method. The texture is heavier and denser than a pour over. For this reason, though French press coffee is delicious black, it thrives with milk or cream.</p>
    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>French press is an immersion brew method, meaning coffee grounds are fully immersed in water and then strained using a metal filter. Metal filters allow oils and undissolved coffee particles to pass into the cup.</p>    <p>If the pour over brew method appeals, but you’re eager to brew more than one cup at a time, the classic Chemex carafe can brew up to 8 cups of coffee at time.  </p>
    <h3>Tips on Grind</h3>
    <p>A medium grind size that’s slightly coarser than for a pour over is optimal, like very coarse black pepper.  </p>    
    <h3>Who's It For?</h3>
    <p>French Press is accessible to anyone, and works particularly well for people who love their coffee with breakfast, as the French Press doubles as a serving carafe and comes in a variety of sizes. </p>
